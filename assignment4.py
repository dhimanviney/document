##Shallow copy###
##A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references
##to the child objects found in the original. In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep.
##The copying process does not recurse and therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.
##DEEP COPY##
##A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a new collection object and
##then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. Copying an object
##this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.
